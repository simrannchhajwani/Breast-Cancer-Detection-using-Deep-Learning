# Breast-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Developed a deep learning model for classifying breast cancer, achieving 99.45% accuracy on histopathology images. This project uses a Swin V2 Transformer with CLAHE-enhanced data from the BreaKHis dataset to deliver state-of-the-art diagnostic performance for benign and malignant tissue detection.
